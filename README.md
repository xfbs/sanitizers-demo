# LLVM Sanitizers Demos

These are a few little demos for the LLVM sanitizers. 

If you compile and run them, you will see that each of them prints a little error message after being run. This error message isn't generated by the code itself, but rather by the sanitizers baked into the binary by `clang`. These can help in debugging the code by detecting errors at runtime (dynamic analysis). Hence it is useful to have these checks enabled during testing, when ideally all code is being touched.

## Installing

Install libjansson, pkg-config and the llvm build system. On Debian-based systems, you can do it like this:

    $ apt install libjansson4 libjansson-dev build-essential clang clang-format pkg-config

On macOS, you can do it like this:

    $ brew install llvm pkg-config jansson


## Caveats

If compiling under macOS, you can't use the version of clang that Apple ships by default because it doesn't have support for the sanitizers compiled in. Instead, you have to install clang from Homebrew.

    $ brew install llvm

The Makefile detects when it's being built under macOS and uses the Homebrew version of `clang` and `clang-format`.
